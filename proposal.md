### **Project Proposal: A Generative, Hierarchical Atlas of Human Brain Function**

**Version:** 4.0 (Final Technical Specification)
**Date:** October 26, 2023

---

#### **1. Executive Summary & Scientific Vision**

This document specifies the definitive technical implementation for a deep generative modeling framework designed to learn a latent representation of human brain function from coordinate-based meta-analytic data. Our objective is to transcend the limitations of classical, linear meta-analysis by creating a dynamic, hierarchical, and rigorously validated generative atlas. This framework will serve as a powerful tool for quantitative synthesis, hypothesis generation, and predictive modeling of the cognitive neuroscience literature.

**Core Scientific Objectives:**
1.  **Learn a Disentangled & Hierarchical Latent Space:** Compress ~12,000 fMRI studies into a low-dimensional space where axes correspond to coherent neurocognitive processes, organized according to their natural cognitive hierarchy.
2.  **Achieve High-Fidelity & Calibrated Generation:** Synthesize realistic, anatomically precise brain activation maps conditioned on cognitive tasks and methodological parameters, complete with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.
3.  **Model & Mitigate Systematic Bias:** Actively model and de-bias for known confounds, including publication trends, scanner technology, and methodological choices, to isolate true neurocognitive signals.
4.  **Map the Temporal Dynamics of Neuroscience:** Create a predictive model of scientific evolution by analyzing the trajectory of research through the learned latent space over time.

#### **2. Hardened Data Curation & Preprocessing Pipeline**

Our data pipeline is designed for maximum fidelity and robustness, treating potential sources of error as signals to be modeled or explicitly mitigated.

*   **2.1 Coordinate & Volumetric Processing:**
    *   **Scale & Orientation Augmentation:** For the volumetric C-VAE, each study's foci will be convolved with a Gaussian kernel whose FWHM is randomly sampled from {6mm, 12mm}. The kernel's orientation will also be randomly perturbed with anisotropic scaling (±20% along x, y, and z axes) to discourage axis-aligned artifacts and improve model robustness for small, non-spherical structures (e.g., thalamic nuclei, brainstem).
    *   **Talairach Correction & Logging:** All coordinates will be explicitly converted from Talairach to MNI space using the `tal2icbm` (Lancaster 2007) matrix. Studies with a root-mean-square deviation > 4mm post-transformation will be logged to a JSON file for a specific post-hoc exclusion analysis.

*   **2.2 Data Integrity & Metadata Handling:**
    *   **Directional Deduplication:** To prevent inflation of simple patterns, coordinate sets will be hashed based on a tuple of (rounded coordinates + voxel sign of t/z-statistic), ensuring that contrasts with identical locations but opposite effects are treated as distinct. Within each unique hash per publication, only the contrast with the largest sample size will be retained.
    *   **Uncertainty-Aware Metadata Imputation:** For metadata with >50% missingness (e.g., `field_strength`), an amortization head will be trained to predict a distribution (`μ`, `log σ²`) over the missing values. This imputation uncertainty (`σ`) will be propagated via the reparameterization trick into the conditioning network, allowing the model to dynamically down-weight its reliance on low-confidence imputed metadata.

#### **3. State-of-the-Art Model Architectures**

Our framework leverages a triad of complementary architectures, each hardened with best-practice refinements.

##### **3.1 Primary Model: Conditional β-VAE (3D CNN)**
*   **Backbone with Full Receptive Field:** The encoder/decoder will be a 3D **ResNet-10**. The final block will incorporate **dilated convolutions** to expand the receptive field to >150mm, ensuring the deepest layers can model whole-brain spatial dependencies.
*   **Stable Normalization:** We will use **Group Normalization** with a fixed number of groups (`groups=8`) to guarantee at least 4 channels per group across all layers, ensuring stable normalization statistics even with a batch size of 16.

##### **3.2 Precision Model: Point-Cloud C-VAE**
*   **Normalized EMD Loss:** To satisfy the mass conservation constraint of Earth Mover's Distance, each input point cloud will be normalized to a fixed size of N=30 points via probabilistic duplication (for clouds with <30 foci) or stochastic dropout (for clouds with >30 foci). The reconstruction loss will then be a weighted sum of Chamfer Distance and Sinkhorn EMD.
*   **Optimized Positional Encoding:** Raw coordinates will be augmented with **Gaussian Random Fourier Features**. The feature bandwidth (`σ`) will be carefully selected (via a small pilot study) in the range of `10⁻² mm⁻¹` to ensure sensitivity to cortical-scale structure without aliasing.

##### **3.3 Hierarchy Model: Hierarchical VAE Prototype (Stage-Gated)**
*   **Three-Level Stability:** The prototype will be a two-level hierarchy to ensure stability. If successful, a three-level model will only be attempted if protected by auxiliary losses.
*   **Protected Skip Paths:** Skip connections from the encoder to the decoder will have gradients stopped (`.detach()`) with respect to the encoder path. This prevents the model from learning a trivial identity mapping that bypasses the KL divergence penalty at lower latent levels, forcing it to learn meaningful hierarchical representations.

#### **4. Advanced Conditioning, De-biasing & Uncertainty Quantification**

##### **4.1 Conditioning & De-biasing:**
*   **Dual FiLM Conditioning:** **FiLM** layers will modulate feature maps in *both* the encoder and decoder, providing the model with full conditional expressiveness to both interpret and generate data based on metadata.
*   **Scheduled GRL:** The Gradient Reversal Layer's weight (`λ`) for the adversarial de-biasing head will ramp up *after* the initial KL annealing phase (e.g., from epoch 20 to 80) to prevent training instability during the critical early stages. The adversarial head itself will be a minimal MLP (64→1 neurons) to ensure it learns low-frequency trends rather than memorizing individual latent codes.

##### **4.2 Gold-Standard Uncertainty:**
*   **Diversity-Boosted Deep Ensembles:** We will train a **Deep Ensemble of K=5 models** to estimate epistemic uncertainty. To maximize diversity among ensemble members within a single training run, we will use **snapshot ensembling** with a cyclical learning rate schedule (e.g., cosine with restarts).
*   **Calibrated Aleatoric Uncertainty:** In addition to predicting voxel-wise `μ`, the decoder head of each ensemble member will predict `log σ²` for aleatoric uncertainty. Post-training, we will compute the **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)** on held-out NeuroVault maps. If ECE > 0.1, we will apply temperature scaling to the model's logits to improve calibration.

#### **5. Hardened Training & Evaluation Protocol**

##### **5.1 Training & Monitoring:**
*   **Optimizer:** We will use **AdamW** with `β₂=0.995` for improved stability of the KL divergence term during training.
*   **Dynamic KL Control:** A controller will monitor the KL divergence. If it falls below 90% of its target value for more than 3 consecutive epochs, the `β` hyperparameter will be automatically increased by 10% to counteract posterior collapse.
*   **Precision-Aware Training:** The point-cloud VAE, which relies on stable Sinkhorn gradients, will be trained in full FP32 precision. The volumetric VAE will use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) to optimize memory and speed.

##### **5.2 Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics:**
| Domain | Metric | Implementation Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Generative Realism**| **Improved PRD** | We will compute Precision & Recall for Distributions using the state-of-the-art method from Kynkäänniemi et al. (2022), which is designed for high-dimensional continuous data. |
| **Zero-Shot Task Classification**| **Linear Probe** | A logistic regression probe will be trained on latent vectors from 10% of HCP task contrasts to classify cognitive domains. Its balanced accuracy on the remaining 90% will be benchmarked against a Neurosynth term-vector baseline. |
| **Temporal Forecast Quality**| **Fréchet Distance**| The quality of the latent trajectory forecast will be measured by the Fréchet Distance between the distribution of predicted latent vectors for year Y and the distribution of actual latent vectors from year Y. |

#### **6. Reproducibility & Stretch Goals**

*   **Full Determinism:** We will set the `TORCH_DETERMINISTIC=1` environment variable and explicitly enable cuDNN's deterministic convolution algorithms to ensure bit-wise reproducibility across hardware.
*   **Stretch Goal: Latent Diffeomorphic Consistency:** As a final, low-cost extension, we will train a small diffeomorphic flow model within the final latent space. This will allow for "semantic editing," ensuring that linear interpolations between two points in the space correspond to smooth, monotonic transformations in the generated brain maps, leading to more compelling and interpretable demonstrations.
