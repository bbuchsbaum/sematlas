# VS1.2.3 Validation Status Report

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

### ✅ PASS: Validation framework created and tested with untrained model
- Created `validate_baseline_latents.py` script with comprehensive validation functions
- Successfully tested encoding, reconstruction, and latent traversal capabilities
- Generated baseline report with untrained model at `validation_outputs/untrained_baseline/`
- Baseline MSE: 0.1116
- Baseline diversity score: 8.670
- Automated report generation working correctly

### ✅ PASS: Background training run started and progressing
- Created `configs/background_validation_vae.yaml` for 10-epoch training run
- Started training process (PID: 89363) using `.venv_training` environment
- Training is progressing at ~0.07 it/s (slow but steady)
- Configured to save checkpoints after each epoch
- Logging to `background_training.log`

### ⏳ PENDING: Trained model encodes real brain data to latent vectors
- Awaiting training completion to validate

### ⏳ PENDING: Latent space traversal produces visibly different brain patterns
- Awaiting training completion to validate

### ⏳ PENDING: Reconstructions are anatomically plausible
- Awaiting training completion to validate

### ⏳ PENDING: Reconstruction MSE shows ≥50% improvement from untrained baseline
- Baseline MSE established: 0.1116
- Target MSE: ≤0.0558 (50% improvement)
- Awaiting training completion to validate

### ✅ PASS: Automated validation report generated with visualizations
- Framework generates JSON report with all metrics
- Creates visualization PNG files for reconstruction and traversal
- Summary text file for quick review

## Current Status

1. **Validation Framework**: Complete and tested
   - All validation functions working correctly
   - Handles both trained and untrained models
   - Generates comprehensive reports with visualizations

2. **Background Training**: In progress
   - Started at 2025-08-03 14:25:26
   - Currently on Epoch 0, step 7/771
   - Estimated time to complete first epoch: ~3 hours
   - Estimated time for 10 epochs: ~30 hours

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Monitor training progress periodically
   - Once checkpoint is saved, run validation on trained model
   - Compare with baseline to verify ≥50% improvement
   - Update demo systems if validation passes

## Commands for Monitoring

```bash
# Check training progress
tail -f background_training.log

# Check for saved checkpoints
ls -la checkpoints/validation_background/

# Run validation on trained model (when ready)
python validate_baseline_latents.py \
  --checkpoint checkpoints/validation_background/last.ckpt \
  --output-dir validation_outputs/trained_model \
  --compare-baseline validation_outputs/untrained_baseline/validation_report.json
```

## Recommendation

Given the slow training speed (0.07 it/s), consider:
1. Using a smaller subset of data for faster validation
2. Running on GPU if available
3. Reducing model complexity for validation purposes

The validation framework is fully functional and ready to validate the trained model once available.
