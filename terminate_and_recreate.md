# Steps to Get a GPU Pod:

1. **Terminate the current pod** (0 GPU pod is useless)
   - Click "Stop" then "Terminate" in RunPod console
   - This stops the $0.345/hr charge

2. **Create a new pod with GPU**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Select "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090" 
   - Make sure "GPU Count" is set to 1 (not 0\!)
   - Choose "Secure Cloud" for better availability
   
3. **Alternative GPUs if RTX 4090 unavailable**:
   - RTX 3090 (24GB) - Good alternative
   - RTX A5000 (24GB) - More expensive but often available
   - RTX A4000 (16GB) - Sufficient for our needs

4. **Tips**:
   - Check different regions for availability
   - Consider spot instances if on-demand is full
   - Early morning US time often has better availability
